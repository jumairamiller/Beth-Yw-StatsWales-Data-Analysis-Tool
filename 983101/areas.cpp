  The file contains the Areas class implementation. Areas are the top
  level of the data structure in Beth Yw? for now.

  Areas is also responsible for importing data from a stream (using the
  various populate() functions) and creating the Area and Measure objects.

  This file contains numerous functions you must implement. Each function you
  must implement has a TODO block comment.

  TODO: Areas::populateFromAuthorityCodeCSV(is, cols, areasFilter)

  This function specifically parses the compiled areas.csv file of local 
  authority codes, and their names in English and Welsh.

  This is a simple dataset that is a comma-separated values file (CSV), where
  the first row gives the name of the columns, and then each row is a set of
  data.

  For this coursework, you can assume that areas.csv will always have the same
  three columns in the same order.

  Once the data is parsed, you need to create the appropriate Area objects and
  insert them in to a Standard Library container within Areas.

  @param is
    The input stream from InputSource

  @param cols
    A map of the enum BethyYw::SourceColumnMapping (see datasets.h) to strings
    that give the column header in the CSV file

  @param areasFilter
    An umodifiable pointer to set of umodifiable strings for areas to import,
    or an empty set if all areas should be imported

  @return
    void

  @see
    See datasets.h for details of how the variable cols is organised

  @see
    See bethyw.cpp for details of how the variable areasFilter is created

  @example

  TODO: Areas::populateFromWelshStatsJSON(is,

                                          yearsFilter)

  Data from StatsWales is in the JSON format, and contains three
  top-level keys: odata.metadata, value, odata.nextLink. value contains the
  data we need. Rather than been hierarchical, it contains data as a
  continuous list (e.g. as you would find in a table). For each row in value,
  there is a mapping of various column headings and their respective vaues.

  Therefore, you need to go through the items in value (in a loop)
  using a JSON library. To help you, I've selected the nlohmann::json
  library that you must use for your coursework. Read up on how to use it here:
  https://github.com/nlohmann/json

  Example of using this library:
    - Reading/parsing in from a stream is very simply using the >> operator:
        json j;
        stream >> j;

    - Looping through parsed JSON is done with a simple for each loop. Inside
      the loop, you can access each using the array syntax, with the key/
      column name, e.g. data["Localauthority_ItemName_ENG"] gives you the
      local authority name:
        for (auto& el : j["value"].items()) {
           auto &data = el.value();
           std::string localAuthorityCode = data["Localauthority_ItemName_ENG"];
           // do stuff here...
        }

  In this function, you will have to parse the JSON datasets, extracting
  the local authority code, English name (the files only contain the English
  names), and each measure by year.

  If you encounter an Area that does not exist in the Areas container, you
  should create the Area object

  If areasFilter is a non-empty set only include areas matching the filter. If
  measuresFilter is a non-empty set only include measures matching the filter.
  If yearsFilter is not equal to <0,0>, only import years within the range
  specified by the tuple (inclusive).

  I've provided the column names for each JSON file that you need to parse
  as std::strings in datasets.h. This mapping should be passed through to the
  cols parameter of this function.

  Note that in the JSON format, years are stored as strings, but we need
  them as ints. When retrieving values from the JSON library, you will
  have to cast them to the right type.

  @param is
    The input stream from InputSource

  @param cols
    A map of the enum BethyYw::SourceColumnMapping (see datasets.h) to strings
    that give the column header in the CSV file

  @param areasFilter
    An umodifiable pointer to set of umodifiable strings of areas to import,
    or an empty set if all areas should be imported

  @param measuresFilter
    An umodifiable pointer to set of umodifiable strings of measures to import,
    or an empty set if all measures should be imported

  @param yearsFilter
    An umodifiable pointer to an umodifiable tuple of two unsigned integers,
    where if both values are 0, then all years should be imported, otherwise
    they should be treated as the range of years to be imported (inclusively)

  Each row contains an authority code and values for each year (or no value

  Note that these files do not include the names for areas, instead you 
  have to rely on the names already populated through
