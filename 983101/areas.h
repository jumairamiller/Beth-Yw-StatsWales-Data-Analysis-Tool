  This file contains the Areas class, which is responsible for parsing data
  from a standard input stream and converting it into a series of objects:

  Measure       â€” Represents a single measure for an area, e.g.
   |              population. Contains a human-readable label and a map of
   |              the measure across a number of years.
   |
   +-> Area       Represents an area. Contains a unique local authority code
        |         used in national statistics, a map of the names of the area 
        |         (i.e. in English and Welsh), and a map of various Measure 
        |         objects.
        |
        +-> Areas A class that contains all Area objects.

  TODO: Read the block comments with TODO in areas.cpp to know which 
  functions and member variables you need to declare in this class.

  Areas is a class that stores all the data categorised by area. The 
  underlying Standard Library container is customisable using the alias above.

  To understand the functions declared below, read the comments in areas.cpp
  and the coursework worksheet. Briefly: populate() is called by bethyw.cpp to
  populate data inside an Areas instance. This function will hand off the
  specific parsing of code to other functions, based on the value of 
  BethYw::SourceDataType.

  TODO: Based on your implementation, there may be additional constructors
  or functions you implement here, and perhaps additional operators you may wish
  to overload.
