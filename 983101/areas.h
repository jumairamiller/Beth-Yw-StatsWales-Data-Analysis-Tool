  This file contains the Areas class, which is responsible for parsing data
  from a standard input stream and converting it into a series of objects:

  Measure       â€” Represents a single measure for an area, e.g.
   |              population. Contains a human-readable label and a map of
   |              the measure accross a number of years.
   |
   +-> Area       Represents an area. Contains a unique local authority code
        |         used in national statistics, a map of the names of the area 
        |         (i.e. in English and Welsh), and a map of various Measure 
        |         objects.
        |
        +-> Areas A class that contains all Area objects.

  TODO: Read the block comments with TODO in areas.cpp to know which 
  functions and member variables you need to declare in this class.

  Areas is a class that stores all the data categorised by area. The

  To understand the functions declared below, read the comments in areas.cpp
  and the coursework worksheet. Briefly: populate() is called by bethyw.cpp to
  populate data inside an Areas instance. This function will hand off the
  specific parsing of code to other functions, based on the value of 
  BethYw::SourceDataType.

  TODO: Based on your implementation, there may be additional constructors
  or functions you implement here, and perhaps additional operators you may wish
  to overload.
